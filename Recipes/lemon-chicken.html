            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup milk (optional)</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning </li>
                <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
                <li>1/2 cup milk (optional)</li>
                <li>1/3 stick unsalted butter (optional)</li>
                <li>4 lemons, sliced</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F v(175 degrees C
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whip milk and egg together in a small bowl. Mix flour and lemon-pepper seasoning together in another small bowl.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dip chicken in egg mixture and then in flour to coat completely. Place milk and
                    butter in the bottom of a baking dish to keep the x=chicken nice and moist.
                    Place coated chicken on top. Place lemon slices directly on the chicken. Cover with foil.
                </li>
                <li>
                        Bake in the pre-heated oven until almost cooked through, about
                        30 mins. Remove foil and continue to bake until no longer pink in
                        the centers and juices run clear, about 15 mins more.
                        An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should 
                        read at least 165 degress F (74 degrees C).
